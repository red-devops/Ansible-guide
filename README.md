Ansible guide
---
The content of this project is part of the post on blog https://red-devops.pl/<br>
The repository was created to teach the basics of deploying applications using the Ansible tool.<br>
In this example, we use dynamic inventory with the aws_ec2 plugin to get IP address instances from the AWS cloud to deploy an application written in Java.


The application artifact will be downloaded from the repository: <b>red-devops/CharlenesCoffeeCorner</b>
